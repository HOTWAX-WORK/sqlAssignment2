-- EXPLANATION
-- It starts with order_header to get order-related information and links it to order_role to filter only customer orders.
-- The person table is joined to retrieve customer names, while address details are obtained through order_contact_mech, contact_mech, and postal_address.
-- A filter on STATE_PROVINCE_GEO_ID = 'NY' ensures only New York orders are selected.
-- Finally, GROUP BY oh.ORDER_ID prevents duplicate entries and ensures each order appears once.
